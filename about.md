<div class="about">

Hi,
<br><br>
My name is Kristof and i started as a junior system administrator in 2011.<br>
Between 2011 and 2020 , together with another sysadmin, i was responsible for +- 360 employees and 450 client devices, spread out over 20 different locations. In march of 2020 i took on a new role as a Infrastructure Engineer at the Windows Server Team.
<br><br>
Over the years i developed an interest in many aspects.<br>
WinDB, WPA (Windows performance Analyzer), SCCM, Powershell are the ones i find most interesting.<br>
<br><br>
The idea is to use this blog to write about the more fun or challenging problems i come across. 
I'll mainly be blogging for my own reference but maybe my work can be of use to someone else aswell. This can be a PowerShell script, but it can also be a WPA analysis, a GPO solution , ... .<br>
